function bounds = mask2bounds(img,isobjectblack)
%% takes in an image mask and extracts boundaries and centroids from it
% Original version written by George Lee in time immemorial

% Updated by Patrick Leo, June 2018
% - added parfor loop and all associated code to run in parallel
% - removed unneeded code for vectorizing mask and working with it in
% vector form

% Updated by Patrick Leo, October 2018
% Replaced this whole mess with matlab builtin functions for a billion
% percent speedup

% threshold - get rid of bad image compression in jpg.
